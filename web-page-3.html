                Gryffindor values bravery, daring, nerve, and chivalry. Its emblematic animal is the lion and its
                colours are scarlet and gold. Minerva McGonagall was the most recent Head of Gryffindor. Sir Nicholas de
                Mimsy-Porpington, also known as "Nearly Headless Nick", was the house ghost. The founder of the house
                was Godric Gryffindor. Gryffindor corresponds to the element of Fire. The common room was located in one
                of the highest towers at Hogwarts, the entrance was situated on the seventh floor in the east wing of
                the castle and is guarded by a portrait of The Fat Lady. She permits entrance if given the correct
                password, which is changed numerous times throughout the school year. Famous Gryffindors include Albus
                Dumbledore, Harry Potter, and Celestina Warbeck.

Ravenclaw students must answer a riddle as opposed to giving a password to enter their dormitories. This riddle, however, can be answered by non-Ravenclaws. Famous Ravenclaws include Gilderoy Lockheart, Ignatia Wildsmith (inventor of Floo powder), and Garrick Ollivander.
